Reflection#1 @L2E5:
	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates an empty repo and a file named ".git/"
	Because otherwise I would not have a repo to commit.


Reflection#2 @L2E8:
	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is not working directory. because the files in staging area are in a different position then not-added files.
	It is not repository. Because the files in staging area have not commited yet.
	It offers a way to create logically-meaningful and rich repository at the creation level of that repository. Say I forget to create the repo at the beginning of the project. I may create the repo whenever I want and yet I have a chance to make logically-meaningful and beautiful commits.



Reflection#3 @L2E13:
	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I may have done more than one logical change. With staging area I can split these changes into logival sub-groups and decide which one goes first, second ... etc.

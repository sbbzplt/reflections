Reflection #1 @L3P7:
	When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	* If I'm doing collaborators on that project 
	* If I need some external help 
	* If I'm a person who does not like to carry a laptop and works in several different places and pc's
	*

Reflection #3 @L3P10:
	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Otherwise git would not have any differences from Drive or Dropbox at all.

Reflection #4 @L3P14:
	Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	clone downloads a repo to one's local.
	fork works on github-only and creates a copy of another's github-repo to one's account.
	branch works totally different. It creates a parallel highway to work.
	If repo is on github and I'm NOT a collaborator of it, then I fork it.
	If repo is on github and I'm a collaborator of it, then I clone it.
	If I want to make a major change on a project, then regardless of its position I branch it.

Reflection #5 @l3p22:
	What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can work on the project knowing that you are moving ahead of the remote copy. Thus you know that you should check the diff on remote before you push.

Reflection #1 @L3P7:
	When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	* If I'm doing collaborators on that project 
	* If I need some external help 
	* If I'm a person who does not like to carry a laptop and works in several different places and pc's
	*

Reflection #3 @L3P10:
	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Otherwise git would not have any differences from Drive or Dropbox at all.
